    "introduction": "Back in 2016, I began my academic path in Engineering Physics and Mathematics at Aalto University, where I also wrote my first lines of code. While I initially focused on physics and math, it didn't take long for programming to capture my curiosity. I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering Physics and Math, but my growing passion for software led me to make a pivotal decision: for my Master's, I shifted my major to Computer Science — a move that kickstarted my deeper journey into web development.",
    "main": "Since December 2021, I've been working at Veikkaus as part of the mobile development team. After completing my Master's thesis and graduating in Spring 2022, my role expanded to include building new features, running A/B tests, maintaining production systems, and deploying OTA updates — among other responsibilities. Through all of this, my focus has remained consistent: to continuously improve as a software engineer and build products that are performant, maintainable, and user-focused.",
    "end": "When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me on a skateboard, lifting at the gym, or losing my sanity to my small, endlessly stubborn (but still ridiculously cute) dog. I value balance, creativity, and staying curious — both in and out of the codebase."
