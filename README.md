## Tech Stack and CI/CD

My website is built and maintained using a range of technologies and a simple CI/CD pipeline, ensuring a balance of quality and efficiency:

- **Frontend Development**:
    - **React**: For building user interface components.
    - **TypeScript**: Utilized for its strong typing system to enhance code quality and maintainability.
    - **CSS and SVG**: For styling, alongside the use of SVG components for enhanced visual appeal.
    - **React Hooks**: Employed for state management and side effects in functional components.
    - **i18next**: Used for localizations, manages English & Finnish translations.

- **Data Management**:
    - **Data Fetching**: Content is dynamically loaded from JSON files within the repository, using custom hooks for fetching data.

- **CI/CD**:
    - **GitHub Actions**: Automates the integration and deployment process, running tests and linting on each push, ensuring code quality.
    - **Render**: The website is hosted on Render. Deployments are manually triggered through the CI/CD pipeline for greater control and precision in the update process.
