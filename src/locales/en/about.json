    "introduction": "Back in 2016, I launched my academic journey by delving into Engineering Physics and Mathematics at Aalto University, where I first encountered coding as well. While physics and mathematics were my initial focus, coding quickly captivated my interest. I still completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics and Mathematics, but my growing passion for coding led me to a career changing decision. Thus for my Master's studies , I went all in for coding and changed my major to Computer Science. This shift led me to delve deeper into the world of web development, which I have been doing ever since.",
