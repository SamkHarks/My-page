  "end": "When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me on a skateboard, lifting at the gym, or losing my sanity to my small, endlessly stubborn (but still ridiculously cute) dog. I value balance, creativity, and staying curious — both in and out of the codebase.",
  "introduction": "Back in 2016, my engineering journey began at Aalto University. I initially focused on Engineering Physics and Mathematics, a discipline that grounded me in complex problem-solving ranging from Quantum physics to advanced computational methods. Despite this academic focus, my curiosity was quickly captured by code. I completed my Bachelor's but made a career-changing decision to shift my Master's studies towards Computer Science — a move that pivoted my focus into robust software development.",
  "main": "Since December 2021, I have been a Software Engineer at Veikkaus, contributing to the high-traffic mobile application used nationwide. My experience has rapidly evolved into full feature ownership, driving the entire software development lifecycle — from technical guidance for designers, implementing new features and A/B-tests, production maintenance and incident resolution, and deploying critical OTA updates. This extensive, hands-on exposure has reinforced my commitment to building applications that are performant, maintainable, and adhere to stringent user-focused and accessibility standards."
