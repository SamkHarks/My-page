    "introduction": "Back in 2016, I launched my academic journey by leaping into Engineering Physics and Mathematics at Aalto University, where I first encountered coding as well. Although physics and mathematics were my initial focus, coding quickly captivated my interest. I still completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics and Mathematics, but my growing passion for coding led me to a career changing decision. Thus for my Master's studies, I went all in for coding and switched my major to Computer Science. This change marked the beginning of my deeper exploration into web development, which I have been doing ever since.",
    "main": "In December 2021, I began working at Veikkaus as a developer on the mobile development team. I completed my master's thesis and graduated in Spring 2022. Since then, I have focused more on developing new features, implementing A/B tests for different projects, and performing a bit of maintenance work on the side as well. However, my central aim remains the same, to continuously evolve and enhance my skills as a software engineer.",
    "end": "When I'm not on my computer, you'll often find me with my skateboard, unwinding at the gym, or cleaning up after my energetic and adorable little rascal of a puppy"
